  <h2>Thoughts on Accessability</h2>
  Web Accessability means to design websites in a way that they are easy to read, navigate, use, understand and find.
  <h2>Progressive Enhancement Writing</h2>
  <p><p>
    I think that progressive enhancement is about making websites that people will want to use. Although it seems 
    simple, the idea is to build a strong base so that everyone, no matter what browser or internet speed they have, 
    can access the site's basic content and features. After you have that down pat, you can add the extras that people 
    with the newest technology will enjoy, such as animations, interactive elements, or modern graphics.
</p>
<p>
    This approach is very important to me because it includes everyone. I know how frustrating it is when a site just 
    won't work because of old technology. Not everyone has a brand-new phone or super-fast Wi-Fi. With progressive 
    enhancement, no one is left outâ€”not even disabled people or those who live in places with poor connectivity. It's 
    about making something that works for everyone and meets their needs.
</p>
<p>
    Progression makes websites more reliable, which is something I really like about it. If a fancy feature breaks, the 
    main part of the site (the important part) will still work. As explained in 
    <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/what-is-progressive-enhancement" target="_blank">this article by HubSpot</a>, 
    progressive enhancement isn't just a development plan; it's a mindset that says, "I care about everyone who visits 
    this site, not just people with the newest tech." I want to be a part of that web.
