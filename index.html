  <h2>Thoughts on Accessability</h2>
  Web Accessability means to design websites in a way that they are easy to read, navigate, use, understand and find.
  <h2>Progressive Enhancement Writing</h2>
  <p><p>
    I think that progressive enhancement is about making websites that people will want to use. Although it seems 
    simple, the idea is to build a strong base so that everyone, no matter what browser or internet speed they have, 
    can access the site's basic content and features. After you have that down pat, you can add the extras that people 
    with the newest technology will enjoy, such as animations, interactive elements, or modern graphics.
</p>
<p>
    This approach is very important to me because it includes everyone. I know how frustrating it is when a site just 
    won't work because of old technology. Not everyone has a brand-new phone or super-fast Wi-Fi. With progressive 
    enhancement, no one is left outâ€”not even disabled people or those who live in places with poor connectivity. It's 
    about making something that works for everyone and meets their needs.
</p>
<p>
    Progression makes websites more reliable, which is something I really like about it. If a fancy feature breaks, the 
    main part of the site (the important part) will still work. As explained in 
    <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/what-is-progressive-enhancement" target="_blank">this article by HubSpot</a>, 
    progressive enhancement isn't just a development plan; it's a mindset that says, "I care about everyone who visits 
    this site, not just people with the newest tech." I want to be a part of that web.

  <h2>Dragon Project Revision</h2>
  <p>    <p>
    The Dragon Project was one of the hardest and most educational things I've ever done in school. I had been a 
    B-52 airplane mechanic in the US Air Force and worked in aviation. I also hadn't been to school since 2003, 
    so learning how to code felt like joining a whole new world. It was both interesting and scary.
</p>
<p>
    One thing I'm proud of about myself is how hard I worked to learn something so different from what I normally do. 
    I'm very hard on myself, and coding kept reminding me that I'm new to this and don't have the knowledge and skills 
    to be called an expert at it. I agree that learning how to code is a skill that needs time and effort to improve. 
    Even though it was hard, I kept going. I quickly learned that this is a skill that needs time and a readiness to 
    fail before it can be mastered.
</p>
<p>
    There were times when the job made me feel like I couldn't handle it all. I needed help, and Professor Abdullah 
    Al Amin's help was very helpful. From his point of view, I could see what needed to be done better, but he made 
    sure that the choices I made stayed my own. I would have gotten help sooner instead of waiting until I felt like 
    I was going to drown if I could do it all over again. I will remember that lesson as I go on to college.
</p>
<p>
    His comments made a big difference. Besides that, my wife told me I did a good job and told me not to make any 
    more changes. I needed that confidence boost to see the worth in what I had done, and her words gave it to me.
</p>
<p>
    I learned from this project that being able to code isn't just about having the right skills. As you grow, you 
    have to be strong, figure out how to solve problems, and sometimes take a leap of faith. I know I still have a 
    long way to go, but this experience has made me want to keep learning and getting better. Even though The Dragon 
    Project was scary at times, it has also been fun. I'm proud of what I've done and thankful for the help and 
    advice that found me along the way.
